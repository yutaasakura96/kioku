# Decision log

Append-only. The answer to every future "why is it like this?"

**This file is an index, not the record.** Each decision was argued out at the time and written up
as an ADR in [`adr/`](adr/) — the ADR carries the alternatives, the reasoning and the revisit
condition in full, and it is the authority. This page exists so one file answers "what has been
decided" without opening eleven.

## Entries

### [2026-09-03] The smallest loop is Japanese, end to end, and instrumented
Paste ~two pages of Japanese → ~30 vetted cards → studied on two consecutive days, emitting §5's
acceptance rate and time-to-first-review. → [ADR 0001](adr/0001-smallest-loop-is-japanese-end-to-end-and-instrumented.md)

### [2026-09-03] Note and card are separate entities
Anki's separation, not flat cards: vetting cost scales with notes, study volume scales with cards.
A card owns its own scheduling state. → [ADR 0002](adr/0002-note-and-card-are-separate-entities.md)

### [2026-09-03] A subject is a declared schema and a pipeline, living in the repo
One declaration drives the LLM's output contract, the note type's fields and the card templates, and
names the pipeline stages in order. Adding a subject is a code change, not a UI flow.
→ [ADR 0003](adr/0003-a-subject-is-a-declared-schema-and-a-pipeline.md)

### [2026-09-03] Trust follows provenance, not confidence
Trust is a property of where a field came from, recorded per field. Vetting is mandatory in v1.
→ [ADR 0004](adr/0004-trust-follows-provenance-not-confidence.md)

### [2026-09-03] A level is a set of attributed claims, and it only filters
The JLPT publishes no official vocabulary list, by design (verified 2026-09-03). "N3" is an
attributed claim, never a fact about a word. → [ADR 0005](adr/0005-a-level-is-a-set-of-attributed-claims.md)

### [2026-09-03] Note identity is a declared key; collision appends an occurrence
Keyed per subject alongside the schema — for JLPT vocabulary, *(dictionary-form term, reading)*.
Sense-level identity rejected. → [ADR 0006](adr/0006-note-identity-is-a-declared-key-and-collision-appends-an-occurrence.md)

### [2026-09-03] Prefetched sessions and a client-stamped grade outbox
Both of §4.7's options, because each is worthless alone. Online-only (§2.2) is not reopened.
→ [ADR 0007](adr/0007-prefetched-sessions-and-a-client-stamped-grade-outbox.md)

### [2026-09-03] v1 ships no §3 features, and sources stay durable
The scope cut. Sources remain durable and re-enterable.
→ [ADR 0008](adr/0008-v1-ships-no-section-3-features-and-sources-stay-durable.md)

### [2026-09-04] A deck is a saved query
Not an owner of cards. → [ADR 0009](adr/0009-a-deck-is-a-saved-query.md)

### [2026-09-04] Cheap filters run before expensive generation
Ingestion is a streaming background job with a replayable cache key.
→ [ADR 0010](adr/0010-cheap-filters-run-before-expensive-generation.md)

### [2026-09-04] Re-generation proposes; history is never destroyed
Review history is the one thing in the system that cannot be regenerated (§2.4).
→ [ADR 0011](adr/0011-re-generation-proposes-and-history-is-never-destroyed.md)

## Still open

- **§4.12 — the stack.** Deliberately held shut for the whole grilling; belongs to Phase 4. Its
  inputs are now fixed by ADRs 0002, 0003, 0007, 0008, 0009 and 0010.

## Adding an entry

Write the ADR first — that is where the argument lives — then add a line here. Keep the format:

```
### [YYYY-MM-DD] Short decision title
One or two sentences: what was chosen, and the deciding reason.
→ [ADR NNNN](adr/NNNN-slug.md)
```

If a decision is small enough not to warrant an ADR, record it here in full instead, with
**Decision / Alternatives considered / Reason / Revisit if**.
